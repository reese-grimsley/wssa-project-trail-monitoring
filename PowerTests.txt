Measurements
On, board with sensor running consumes about 15-17 mA
	- Fastest loop possible
About 12-13mA when sensor is not running
When in a low power state:
	- 2.7mA with sensor disconnected
	- 4.3mA with sensor connected
	- Unsure if radio is connected in any way or not; haven't explicitly turned anything off
	- IDLE2 is 5.3mA
	- IDLE1 is 8.1mA
	- IDLE0 is 9.4mA
Sensor takes 1.5mA
